                <p class="cont" id="intro">Embarking on a journey to enhance my skills and expand my portfolio, I have taken up the 100 Days UI Design Challenge. This exciting challenge involves creating a unique UI design every day based on prompts received via email. From simple concepts like a user's page to complex and unconventional designs like a car interface, each prompt presents an opportunity to push my boundaries and discover my creative potential. In this blog, I will share my progress and reflections after completing the first batch of 10 projects.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">For the first project, I created a vibrant and user-friendly sign-up page. Using bright and inviting colors, I designed a simple sign-in/sign-up flow that aims to attract users and provide a seamless experience. The page includes essential elements such as text boxes for inputting information and a "forgot your password?" button to ensure convenience and ease of use.</p>

                <p class="cont">For this project, I designed a basic in-app credit card checkout flow. The focus was on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for making payments. The design incorporated features such as saved cards for quick and convenient transactions, as well as the ability to add a new card and input its details. The overall design adopted a toned and minimalist approach, with a touch of an accent color to make buttons easily distinguishable and enhance the visual hierarchy.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">For this project, I undertook the challenge of redesigning the landing page for the online shop of the iconic streetwear brand Stussy. In my assessment, I felt that the existing design didn't fully capture the brand's unique identity and appeared rather basic and unremarkable. With my redesign, I aimed to infuse the landing page with a fresh and bold aesthetic that truly reflects Stussy's cult classic status.
                    To achieve this, I opted for a dark background, which sets the stage for the brand's urban and edgy vibe. Against this backdrop, I incorporated highly contrasting and impactful typography to make key elements stand out. For instance, I utilized a font that emulates graffiti for the collection titles, adding an authentic streetwear touch.
                    The overall design of the landing page was carefully crafted to evoke a sense of excitement and intrigue, enticing visitors to explore the brand's offerings further. By injecting personality and visual energy into the page, I aimed to create a captivating experience that resonates with Stussy's devoted fan base.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">For this project, I took on the challenge of designing a kitchen calculator. The main objective was to create a versatile tool that assists with various calculations commonly required in the kitchen.
                    The design encompasses two key features: unit conversion and appliance measurement calculations. The unit conversion feature enables users to convert between different units of measurement, such as grams to ounces or Celsius to Fahrenheit, providing convenience and flexibility in following recipes.
                    The design of the kitchen calculator prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness. Clear and intuitive controls are implemented to ensure ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly perform the necessary calculations while cooking or baking.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to design an app icon for Lunaria, a side project centered around a fictional first human colony on the Moon. The aim was to create an icon that captures the essence of Lunaria's concept and evokes a sense of adventure and exploration.
                    The icon design embodies the unique nature of Lunaria by incorporating elements associated with the Moon and space exploration. To ensure visual appeal and recognition, the icon utilizes a harmonious color palette and clean lines, allowing for easy recognition and scalability across different device screens. The design is carefully crafted to attract users and convey the app's theme and purpose effectively.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">For this project, I had the opportunity to design two user profile pages inspired by characters from one of my favorite anime, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Each profile incorporates key elements such as the character's name, image, and basic user information, including their role within the series. Additionally, the inclusion of the stats chart of their respective Stands adds depth and significance to the profiles.
                    The overall design aims to create an engaging and immersive experience for fans of the series while providing an organized and visually appealing display of character information.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">In this project, I focused on designing the settings interface for a mobile application. The settings page includes various options for users to personalize their app experience, such as language preferences, subscription options, and account details.
                    The design approach for the settings page is centered around cleanliness, elegance, simplicity, and a dark theme. A clean and organized layout ensures that users can easily navigate through the different settings categories. The use of a dark background adds a touch of sophistication, while a pop of contrasting color draws attention to important elements or calls to action within the settings page.
                    The overall aesthetic aims to provide a visually appealing and intuitive experience for users as they customize their app settings. Clear labels, intuitive icons, and well-structured sections contribute to a seamless and efficient settings interface.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">For this project, I designed a 404 error page specifically tailored for a sushi shop's website. The 404 page aims to provide a delightful and engaging experience for users who encounter a missing or broken link on the site.
                    The design features a stylized illustration of a salmon, one of the most popular sushi fish, adding a touch of playfulness and charm to the page. The salmon illustration is accompanied by a whimsical message in Japanese, "well, well," adding a unique and memorable element to the error page.
                    To ensure clarity and usability, the design incorporates a bright and clean layout. The 404 error information is prominently displayed, ensuring users understand the nature of the error. Additionally, a prominent "home page" return button is provided, enabling users to easily navigate back to the main website and continue their browsing experience.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">In this project, I had the opportunity to design a music player interface that combines a toned yet colorful aesthetic with user-friendly and visually pleasing button placement and design. The music player is designed to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for users as they listen to their favorite music and podcasts.
                    The main page of the music player offers several options to enhance the user's browsing experience. This includes the ability to switch between a music browser and a podcast browser, catering to different preferences and interests. Additionally, the design incorporates features such as notifications, popular playlists or podcasts, and a section displaying the user's last listened tracks or episodes. These elements aim to provide convenience and personalized recommendations to the user.
                    The button placement and design within the music player are carefully considered to ensure intuitive navigation and ease of use. Visually pleasing and easily recognizable icons or buttons allow users to control playback, adjust volume, access additional options, and interact with their music or podcast library effortlessly.
                    The overall design of the music player prioritizes a visually appealing interface while maintaining a user-friendly and intuitive layout. A balance between toned and colorful elements is achieved to create a pleasant and engaging visual experience for the user.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p class="cont">I focused on designing a creative iteration of one of the most popular buttons, the social share button. The design incorporates an animated GIF to showcase the unique animation of the button in action.
                    The social share button design features a visually engaging and interactive experience. When the user clicks on the "share" button, it dynamically splits into smaller, round buttons that offer various sharing options. These options may include copying the post's link or sharing it directly to popular social media platforms.
                    The animation of the button splitting into smaller round buttons adds a touch of creativity and interactivity to the social sharing process. This unique design element not only enhances the visual appeal of the button but also provides users with a seamless and intuitive way to share content across different platforms.
                    The overall design aims to make social sharing a fun and engaging experience, encouraging users to spread content and interact with their networks in an effortless and visually appealing manner.

On the other hand, I crafted an error flash message to clearly present upload glitches. The cloud image within the message conveys the context effectively, allowing user quickly understand the message.</p>

                <p class="cont">For this challenge, I chose to design a beautiful home and product page for a plant shop.

                    Crafting an immersive experience was at the forefront of my mind. From the moment users land on the home page, they are greeted with a visually stunning backdrop, incorporating lush botanical imagery and a harmonious colour palette to evoke a sense of tranquillity.
                    On the product page, I aimed to create an intuitive layout that seamlessly guides users through their shopping journey. Emphasizing clarity and simplicity, I focused on showcasing each plant with high-quality image, accompanied by short and informative description, and pricing information, making it easier than ever for plant enthusiasts to find their perfect green companion. </p>
